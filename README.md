# Indeed Image Convertor

This project is part of Indeed Summer Hackathon 2021.

## Concept

> Our colors reflect the many ways we showcase our brand. A rich range of tones and contrast lets us build for accessibility and tell a distinctive brand story.

<cite>[Indeed Design](https://indeed.design/brand/color)</cite>

This tool allows a user to input a source image and output a copy of that image which uses only a predefined palette of Indeed-approved colours.
